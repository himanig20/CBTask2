    <p style="background: linear-gradient(to top, lavender,thistle); background-repeat:no-repeat; padding:5px">One Direction, often shortened to 1D, are an English-Irish pop boy band formed in London in 2010. The group is composed of Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, and previously Zayn Malik until his departure from the group in March 2015. They became one of the best-selling boy groups of all time before going on an indefinite hiatus in 2016.<br>The group formed in 2010 on the British television show The X Factor, a talent contest for aspiring singers. Each of the five members auditioned and originally competed as a solo performer, but early in the season they were advised to pool their talents. Taking the name One Direction, the boys—all were between 16 and 18 years old at the time—attracted substantial attention, especially from young female viewers, for their charismatic stage presence and vocal skills. Although One Direction ultimately fell short of winning on The X Factor, the show’s mastermind, Simon Cowell, offered the act a recording contract soon after the season ended.</p>
